#Blocitoff

##Overview
Blocitoff uses the Firebase API and AngularJS to create tasks with an expiration date.

To-do lists are notorious for collecting junk - tasks that you want to remember but constantly reprioritize. To solve the problem of to-do list clutter, Blocitoff was born. Blocitoff is a web application that will manage your to-do lists by automatically deleting tasks that have not been completed after seven days.

Our hypothesis is that if the task is not important enough to be completed within seven days, it does not belong on your to-do list.
